# Hardware_Online_Testing-BIST
In this paper we are going to discuss about a hardware insertion called BIST. Our BIST hardware includes an input TPG method and an ORA output. Our goal will be testing our circuit fourfunc by adding BIST hardware architecture and check the hardware redundancy and timing of our test.
