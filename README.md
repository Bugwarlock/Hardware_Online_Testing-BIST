# Hardware Online Testing BIST
In this project, we inserted a hardware called BIST on our target circuit in Verilog in order to test it as it works. Our BIST hardware included an input TPG method and an ORA output. Our goal was testing our circuit Fourfunc by adding BIST hardware architecture and check the hardware redundancy and timing of our test.
This project is done as a computer assignment for Test and Testability course.
